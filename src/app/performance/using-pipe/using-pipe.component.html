<p>using-pipe works!</p>

It seems the pipe template takes less time called but may be there is more memory consumption (Need to check)

See the console to get how many times pipe had been called

Number of times called - {{this.insideFun}}
<button (click)="test()" >Click to see the number of times called function</button>

From Local Funtion: 
<span *ngFor="let data of arrayDatas">
    {{getLabelLocalFn(data)}}
</span>
<br>
From Pipe:
<span *ngFor="let data of arrayDatas">
    {{getLabel | getLabelPipe : data}}
</span>
